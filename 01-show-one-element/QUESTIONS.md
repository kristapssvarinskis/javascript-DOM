> If you click the link to reveal more text and then refresh the page, does the text remain revealed, or is it hidden again? Why?

Your reply here...
It is hidden, because it resets.

> Remove `window.addEventListener("load", function(){` (and the closing `})`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

Your reply here...
It doesnt reveal the text anymore. The purpose of the code is that its the main function.

> Describe the the `addEventListener` method. (Remember that there is a specific, technical, methodical way to describe methods. Your reply should match that format.)
